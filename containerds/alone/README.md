- [containerd GitHub org](https://github.com/containerd)

## further learning

- [containerd.io]() is currently a WIP so the docs are thin
  - [Getting Started - Go code](https://containerd.io/docs/getting-started/)
- Remember the [downloads](https://containerd.io/downloads) has builds to download and instructions for how to do so.
  - Includes links to older versions (way back)
- [GH containerd/containerd.io](https://github.com/containerd/containerd.io) has docs 
  - [including in the `docs` folder, docs not yet on site](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/docs)
- [man pages](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/docs/man)
  - Come bundled with some downloads, so either read on GitHub or watch out for those in extracted files.
- WARNING: `ctr` is not guaranteed to exist forever and have any degree of stability, use it to learn but don't rely on it for mission critical scenarios. I see it solely as a learning tool.
