# Course Managing Docker on Linux Servers

This is the official example repository for course exercise files for my Pluralsight course Managing Docker on Linux Servers.

**This course is a work in progress slated to be live yet in 2020**

[Course link](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/managing-docker-linux-servers) *(once complete, for now this is dead)*

# Organization

Each module of the course has a corresponding folder for examples:
- [installing](./installing/)
- [contexts](./contexts/)
- [securing](./securing/)
- [containerd](./containerd/)
- [updating](./updating/)

The master branch contains the history of commits from zero to finished so you can step through the course history as the samples are developed. Enjoy!
