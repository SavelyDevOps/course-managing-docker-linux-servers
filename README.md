# Course Managing Docker on Linux Servers

This is the official example repository for course exercise files for my Pluralsight course Managing Docker on Linux Servers.

**This course is a work in progress slated to be live yet in 2020**

[Course link](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/managing-docker-linux-servers) *(once complete, for now this is dead)*

# Organization

Each module of the course has a corresponding folder for examples:

- [installing](./installing/)
- [contexts](./contexts/)
- [securing](./securing/)
- [containerd](./containerd/)
- [updating](./updating/)

The master branch contains the history of commits from zero to finished so you can step through the course history as the samples are developed. Enjoy!

## Index of Examples

- Step by step install of Docker on [Centos Linux 8](./installing/centos-8/), this example is meant to break down the general steps to build a learning VM (regardless the distro you chose and the general package management steps necessary to install docker with the bundled OS package manager, `yum` in the case of CentOS)


# Links

- [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
  - [References]( https://docs.docker.com/reference/) - I like the new emphasis on types of docs... [references](https://docs.docker.com/reference/) I frequently visit so I'm glad I can give you a [single entry point to find all refs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).
